<h2> MY FAVORITE HEROES AND THEIR STORIES FROM MOBILE LEGENDS! </h2>
<p> Enjoy! </p>
<img src="img/zilong.jpg" alt="">
	<h1> ZILONG </h1>
	<h4> Quote:"Your impudence will not be tolerated!" "Now, I am one with my spear." "Only the fearless heart can soar to the heavens." "Weapons are meant to protect, nothing else." "Nothing scares me, not even death." "The Dragonborn is back!" "It would take an army to stop me!" "Be mighty... Be righteous." </h4>
	<h5><li>Zilong was born in the quiet and peaceful Cadia Riverlands. In his limited memory, he remembered his father being a craftsman who drifted around the land. Every year, as the seasons changed, he traveled back and forth between the north and south, while Zilong's mother held their young child in her arms with a smile, sitting in their carriage, watching Zilong's father yelling all the way.

But that's where the memories of his parents ended. On the way to their next destination, a violent wind struck and destroyed their carriage, scaring away the horses pulling them along. After the wind subsided, the young Zilong found himself alone, his parents nowhere to be found. In his helplessness, the young Zilong wandered across the desolate wastelands for seven days. Through his despair and the countless difficulties that befell him, Zilong showed resilience and potential far beyond any ordinary person, and never gave up in his quest for survival. When Zilong was on the verge of utter exhaustion, a white-bearded old man with wide robes and gaping sleeves floated down to him and brought him to a mysterious place.

After ascending a seemingly endless flight of steps, Zilong came to the magnificent temple of the Great Dragon. He was taken in by the Great Dragon and lived at the Dragon Altar for seven years.

After these seven years, the Great Dragon, who had not accepted any more apprentices for many years, announced that he would choose a successor from either Zilong or Ling. However, the Great Dragon did not select the winner of the contest, the considerably more talented Ling, as his successor. Instead, he chose Zilong, who lacked the skill of his peer.

Everyone was surprised and puzzled by the Great Dragon's decision. The adherents of the Dragon Altar all questioned the strength of this ordinary young man, and why the Great Dragon had chosen him as his successor. Only the Great Dragon knew of the potential that lay within the seemingly ordinary Zilong. Among his adherents, the strongest would always compete to exhibit their strength and the underdog would compete to improve their strength. The strongest would never be able to reach the same level of determination and open-mindedness as one who is eager to reach new heights of greatness.

And soon, Zilong also justified this decision through his own actions. Although he was not the most outstanding student, he had a calm and resilient heart, an upright and brave personality, and a kind and selfless character. He was adopted by the Great Dragon, but often posed as an ordinary holy man, helping the people of the Cadia Riverlands through the calamities and hardships brought their way, and aiding them in times of danger and distress.

These precious qualities possessed by Zilong seeped into the hearts of everyone in the Dragon Altar, and even into the hearts of the people of the Cadia Riverlands, earning him the trust and recognition of all. When Zilong was eighteen years old, the Great Dragon bestowed the Great Dragon Spear upon him, the most prized treasure of the Dragon Altar, in front of everyone. This Dragon Spear, which had witnessed thousands of years of history, not only contained unrivaled power, but also signified that the Great Dragon had formally handed over the responsibility of guarding the Cadia Riverlands to Zilong.

In the following years, Zilong and his Great Dragon Spear traversed almost every inch of the Cadia Riverlands, defeating the powerful enemies who dared invade the Land of Promise one after another, and thus cementing his reputation as the savior of his people.

But just when everyone thought that Zilong could truly take over the mantle of the Great Dragon and become a strong and dependable guardian of the Cadia Riverlands, his fated foe, Yu Zhong, appeared on the continent once again.

Driven mad by ambition, Yu Zhong was banished by the Great Dragon. However, he unexpectedly recovered the reversed scale of the Black Dragon and returned with a vengeance. Under the guidance of the Great Dragon, Zilong, together with Baxia, Ling, and Wanwan, formed the Oriental Fighters, shouldering the heavy responsibility of protecting this peaceful and beautiful land from those who would destroy it. </li> </h5>

	<h1> LAYLA </h1>
	<h4>Quote: "Hope only dies when you give in." "Keep it up, until you're as brilliant as me!" "We can do it." "From now on, I would never back down." </h4>
	<h5><li>In Eruditio, the world's forefront of science and technological advancement, one can find countless brilliant inventors. Layla was born into a family such inventors. But because of the time-consuming nature of their work, Layla's parents had no time to devote to their daughter. As a result, she was raised primarily by her elderly grandfather.

As the most outstanding scientists in Eruditio, Layla's parents had always hoped that she would continue to expand her knowledge of science and become inventors like them, leading the vanguard in making new and amazing scientific and technological breakthroughs. However, Layla had no interest in science. She didn't get along with her parents at all, especially not with her father, and developed a personality and interests quite different from theirs. Instead of setting her heart on the mysteries of science, she looked up to her grandfather, a former member of the Eruditio City Guard, and cultivated an adventurous spirit and irrepressible sense of justice under his stewardship.

Under her grandfather's guidance, young Layla would often practice various fighting techniques and find ways to hone her reasoning and investigation skills. As she grew older, her thirst for knowledge grew too, and soon her desire to explore the world beyond her homeland became so strong, she could no longer contain it. In Layla's mind, the technology of Eruditio should not only benefit the city and its people, but should be used to change the world.

However, Layla's father warned her that the world outside Eruditio was lawless and filled with danger, and that young Layla needed to mature a little more before even thinking of embarking any kind of adventure. But Layla's resentment and frustration toward her neglectful father resulted in this warning falling on deaf ears. She ignored him completely, convinced that this lack of support was his way of avoiding his responsibility as a father.

In fact, the truth of the matter was that Layla's father loved her more than anything in the world, and he used the most advanced Leviathan technology of Eruditio to build a Malefic Gun for her. However, fearing that Layla would refuse any gift he tried to give her, Layla's father gave the Malefic Gun to Layla's grandfather, who then handed it to Layla as a gift from him. But what Layla's father hadn't anticipated was that this gift would only cause Layla to yearn for adventure even more.

On her sixteenth birthday, Layla stealthily grabbed her Malefic Gun and slipped out of Eruditio under the cover of darkness to venture into a big, wide world.

She eventually reached a remote city-state in the southwest of the Moniyan Empire, where many children had mysteriously gone missing. Now, she finally had a chance to try out the fighting and tracking skills she had learned from her grandfather. After investigating the region and following the trail of clues, Layla found the gang of criminals who had been kidnapping the city's children, and followed them all the way to their headquarters, determined to put an end to their wicked deeds and rescue the poor children.

But what Layla didn't know, was that these were no ordinary kidnappers, but evil scientists from Laboratory 1718, who were kidnapping innocent young children for use in their horrible human experiments. Enraged at the thought of the kidnapped children's suffering, Layla picked up her Malefic Gun and broke into the holding area.

The difficulty and danger of the ensuing battle far exceeded anything Layla could ever have imagined. In the heat of battle, the Laboratory 1718 operatives recognized the Leviathan technology in Layla's hands, and thus they decided to change the purpose of their operation... Eventually, the kidnapped children were saved, but Layla fell into the hands of the evil scientists, who took away her Malefic Gun. Layla was imprisoned in a dark dungeon, and just when she had lost all hope, she was suddenly released and returned to Eruditio.

But when she returned to Eruditio, an even bigger shock awaited her: Her father had defected from the Scholars' Union and had become a member of the evil Laboratory 1718. All at once, a storm of reproach and responsibility fell upon her. Despite the fact that she never got along with her father, Layla couldn't believe that her calm and rational father would become a member of the fanatical Laboratory 1718.

Layla fell into a mire of confusion, and all she could do to maintain her sanity was focus on training and keep learning constantly in an attempt to forget the reality of the situation she had found herself in. As time went by, Layla grew in maturity, and her old grandfather came to the end of his life.

On his deathbed, Layla's grandfather told her that she had been abducted by Laboratory 1718 because they had recognized the Malefic Gun she wielded, which her father had made for her. After Layla was kidnapped by Laboratory 1718, her father had no choice but to take her place in order to save his beloved daughter. He was taken abroad and forced to serve Laboratory 1718.

Before turning himself over, he made the rest of the family promise to never tell Layla the truth, so that she could grow up without having to bear the burden of guilt for his fate. Layla finally understood the motivation behind everything her father had every done and had said to her, and the true depth of his love.

She understood... and she became stronger. Under the light of the setting sun, Layla picked up the Leviathan rifle prototype her father had left behind and set off on her quest to find Laboratory 1718. </li></h5>

	<h1> MIYA </h1>
	<h4>Quote: "The Forest might burn, The Moon may be dark. But our hope outlives everything." "Where do you think you're going?" "Never back down, or prepare destruction." </h4>
	<h5><li>Though Elves enjoy remarkably long lives, they do not possess immortal bodies. Throughout the long history of the Land of Dawn, This gentle and fragile race endured great pain and suffering before finally making their home in the Azrya Woodlands. Miya lived through all of this.

Born at the end of the era of strife, Miya bore witness to the indescribable tragedies that befell the Elves in the endless war, Followed the Moon Goddess to salvation, then personally experienced the second continental war with the humans, and witnessed many of her people degenerate into Dark Elves after the corruption of the abyss defiled the Shadow Swamp.

Devastated by the ill fate of her race and the scars of war, Miya dreamt of a peaceful life, and this dream finally came true when the Moon Goddess used all her strength to create the Lunar Aegis, sheltering the Elves of the Azrya Woodlands and allowing them to thrive under the aegis's protection.

After this, the Moon Goddess entered a deep slumber, and Miya became a member of the priesthood. For thousands of years, she served in the Luna Temple with absolute piety, praying for the reawakening of the Moon Goddess and that the Goddess would one day be able to protect the disaster-stricken Elves forever.

However, this period in her life was destined to come to an end. With the continuous expansion of the abyss and the demons, the fog of war once again shrouded the Land of Dawn. When the humans and the abyssal demons fell into a stalemate, conflict arose among the Elves in their attitudes toward the war. The faction headed by the 
Estes.png
 Elf King, Estes, believed that the evil abyss would bring disaster to the whole continent, and the Elves must take the initiative to destroy the demons.

Many other Elves believed that their people had suffered enough, and should not become embroiled in war ever again, instead living safely within the borders of the Azrya Woodlands under the protection of the Moon Goddess's Aegis. What Estes just couldn't understand was that his sister, Miya, was on the opposite side of this internal conflict. Though she cherished peace, Miya still firmly remembered the last mandate of the Moon Goddess - to protect her own people, no matter what. Therefore, she did not want to see any more Elven lives sacrificed in the name of righteousness.

In the end, the vast majority of the Elves chose to defend the Azrya Woodlands, but little did they know, they were ushering in another catastrophe. The Lunar Aegis possessed the power to prevent the spread of corruption in their domain, but it could not stop the powerful demon army. In order to attack the Moniyan Empire, the demon army bypassed the insurmountable Lantis Mountains and chose to set out from the Shadow Swamp, invading the Moniyan Plains from the Moonlit Forest.

In the face of the sudden demon army invasion, although the Elves put up a tenacious resistance, the demon army swept through the Moonlit Forest. 
Thamuz.png
 The King of Fire Demons, Thamuz, set fire to the Tree of Life, upon which many Elves resided, raining an inferno of death upon the forest.

Miya blamed herself for the tragedy. She wanted to protect her people by avoiding war, but her inaction resulted in an even bigger greater sacrifice. And so, she prayed day and night in the Luna Temple, hoping that the great Moon Goddess could grant her enlightenment and guide her in the difficult path forward.

However, the sleeping Moon Goddess did not grant Miya the enlightenment she sought, and the light of the Moonlit Forest became dimmer by the day. Estes and some of the other Elves began to weaken as a result of the waning lunar energy. In the distance, the orcs and demons led by 
Balmond.png
 Balmond gathered in the Stormeye Wastelands. This time, their target was not the Moniyan Empire, but the Moonlit Forest itself.

With the great Moon Goddess still asleep, and the strength of Estes declining, Miya had no choice. Whether she was prepared or not, war had finally found her once more. She was forced to shoulder the duties of the Priestess of the Moon and lead her people to defend their homeland. When the sound of the orc war drums could be heard approaching, the troops of the Moonlit Forest also sounded a horn that had not been heard for thousands of years. Miya, the Priestess of the Moon, took up her silver bow, and joined her people to fight in the moonlight.

"Great Moon Goddess, if war should come to this land, sacrifice cannot be avoided. Please give me the strength, courage, and faith to protect my people and our homeland!" </li></h5>

	<h1> LESLEY </h1>
	<h4> Quote: One shot one kill!"You won't even know I've missed.""Dead before they knew me!" </h4>
	<h5><li> Lesley grew up in the Vance household, where her father presided over the noble family's security. During an unexpected attack by a rival family, Lesley's father was killed. As the assailants approached the Vance household, Lesley took up her father's black long rifle and fulfilled her late father's mission. Tears rolled down Lesley's cheeks as she fired shot after shot, surprisingly, each one taking down an assassin. The final tear came as the final shot took down the last of the rival family's men.

Lesley was adopted by the Vance family, with the patriarch of the noble house even putting their sole heir, Harley under her tutelage. Harley, was a natural troublemaker, who used his talents in magic to unintentionally cause trouble for the Vance household. Only Lesley could keep Harley under control. Harley's troublemaking streak was the last part of warmth within Lesley's conscience.

After hearing about how Harley had travelled to the dangerous Land of Dawn after defeating the Boss of Dark Magic, Lesley followed him, along with her trusty heirloom rifle. After she found Harley through a long arduous journey, She discovered that the once immature young boy to have changed through the numerous life experiences he had gone through. She decided it would be best to have her adopted little brother train, alone, while she would silently protect him from within the shadows. From that day on, all the monsters that were inflicted with Harley's magic would also be struck with a black bullet, that would impeccably pierce through their heart. The stories of the magical youngster who was followed by a mysterious black sniper, soon spread across the Land of Dawn, Like wild fire.</li></h5>

	<h1> ALUCARD </h1>
	<h4> Quote: Demons shall bathe in their blood! The light belongs to the righteous!</h4>
	<h5><li> The last great war is a glorious memory for the Moniyans. The powerful Light's Order, together with the Imperial Border Guards, wiped out the demonic strongholds at the Moniyan and Barren Lands pass, driving the fiends back to the hinterlands of the Forsaken Wastes. But for young Alucard, the war was nothing but a terrible memory of pain and misery. His father's second regiment suffered heavy losses due to a rash lone advance. Alucard's father disappeared in the battle, and was later declared dead by the Light's Order.

As they had disobeyed orders, the second regiment was not honored and praised for their sacrifice, but labeled "disobedient" and criticized for their lack of discipline. This was a huge blow to Alucard, who had always regarded his father as a hero and role model. Facing shame and ridicule everywhere he went, the flames of revenge burned within his chest, and he became determined to bring honor to his father's name and eliminate all the demons in the Land of Dawn. And so, he left his hometown and journeyed to the ancient and mysterious Monastery of Light. As the orphaned son of a dead soldier, Alucard was soon accepted into the Monastery of Light.

In the following years, Alucard studied a range of combat skills in the Monastery of Light. With his natural talent and undying determination, he soon became the most promising student among his peers. During his training, Tigreal, Commander of the Light's Order, who had once fought in the second regiment with his father, often visited Alucard in the Monastery of Light, teaching him various advanced combat skills and telling him of his father's heroic deeds.

Tigreal was already famous throughout the Empire at that time, and Alucard respected him greatly, regarding him as an elder brother of sorts. However, whenever he mentioned his father's final battle, Tigreal always fell silent, his eyes filled with a wave of complex emotions. Alucard was skeptical of the idea that his father had died in battle. He was convinced that his father was still alive and was waiting for him somewhere.

At the age of eighteen, Alucard finally completed all of his studies and formal preparations. Encouraged by Tigreal, he became the monastery's Arbiter of Light. He was ordered to go forth and eliminate the demons and heretics hidden throughout the world, and so he picked up his father's old sword, given to him by Tigreal, and set off. In his father's name, and fueled by his deep hatred of demons, Alucard soon became the greatest demon hunter in the world.

An unforeseen incident occurred during a demon hunting operation on the border of the Barren Lands. Alucard was injured by a magic blade, sustaining a wound that could not be healed. Darkness poured into his body from the wound, and his arm began to undergo a strange transformation... In order to prevent the mutation from spreading throughout his whole body, Alucard asked an old smith to help him forge a pair of gauntlets. This was no ordinary smith—he was a survivor of that fated battle, a member of the Light's Order who covered his allies' retreat along with Alucard's father.

He recognized the huge sword in Alucard's hand. After learning who he was, the old man told Alucard that the reason the second regiment was forced so deep into enemy territory was that the high-level knights at that time were greedy for glory and too impulsive, which led to the second regiment finding itself trapped in a tight encirclement. In a moment of desperation, Alucard's father led some soldiers to cover the retreat of the main force headed by Tigreal, and was then swarmed by a tide of demons and disappeared. He was the only survivor, rescued by Alucard's father.

After learning the truth, Alucard returned to the capital and questioned Tigreal about the battle and why he hadn't told him what had really happened that day. Seeing the anger gripping Alucard, Tigreal confessed the guilt he felt for abandoning his allies and the silence he was forced to maintain at the behest of his family. He expressed his willingness to make up for it in any way he could, claiming that he would give his own life if he had to. However, before Tigreal, who was once like a brother to him, the young Alucard was entangled in a web of confusion. He couldn't bear to kill Tigreal, but he couldn't forgive him either.

For the sake of his father's honor, Alucard asked the Empire to reveal the truth of the second regiment and restore his father's name. However, the knights of that battle had become some of the most powerful figures in the Empire. They refused Alucard's request and drove him out of the capital. On top of this, the puritanical Monastery of Light was strongly against Alucard's unnatural right hand, repeatedly making trouble for him and even calling him a heretic. For the longest time, Alucard's deep hatred of the demons and his desire to regain his father's honor had spurred him on in his mission to serve as the Arbiter of Light. But now, faced with the Empire that had betrayed his father, and a church that treated him with scorn, Alucard made an unthinkable decision: To betray the Monastery of Light and fight for himself.

In the following years, Alucard began wandering the Land of Dawn, annihilating demons everywhere he went on his own terms and searching for clues as to his father's whereabouts. His demonic right hand not only brought him great strength, but also became an unstable element which he was forced to hide under his heavy armor every day.

After a string of epic battles, Alucard became known as one of the most legendary fighters in Moniyan. Soon, everyone knew that wherever demons ran rampant, the demon hunter with the dark right hand would no doubt descend from the sky and leave none alive.</li></h5>

	<h1> FRANCO </h1>
	<h4> Quote: One shot, one kill!" "Time to teach you guys a lesson." "A real fighter never runs!" "Let me teach you some rules, crubs! </h4>
	<h5><li>Franco's home is in the eternally Frozen Seas beyond the land of Nost Gal. This continent of ice and snow is where the sea people have made a life for themselves, but the resurrection of Captain Bane has destroyed their formerly peaceful lives. Franco and his comrades have banded together to oppose Bane's rule and bring peace back to the seas.

Frozen Warrior
The harsh natural environment of the distant and wintry Northern Vale shaped those who live there into a brave and martial people. They revered the strong, and took pride in their tall and rugged appearances. They believed that their robust physiques were inherited from their common ancestor ?— the Iceland Golem who once ruled these lands.

To the young Franco, however, this traditional way of thinking was nothing but oppressive. His tribe had lived on the coast of the Frozen Sea for generations, and relied on their large fleet of ships for trade and fishing to support their livelihoods. But the passing years did not make young Franco want to become a grown man. They only made him notice the strange way the others would look at him. Though his father was a harpooner famous throughout the coast, and his brothers were all tall and strong, Franco was small and unimpressive for a Northman. Some even said jokingly that, given Franco's stature, his ancestor was not the Iceland Golem, but the dwarves of legend.

To train strong warriors, the Norther Vale tribes on the coast of the Frozen Sea engaged in intensely competitive games from childhood, and received systematic combat training once they reached puberty, so that they would be ready to engage in long trading missions or fishing journeys upon reaching adulthood. To Franco's embarrassment, however, when the other boys had already started to wield battle axes, spears, and to rig sails, he could only handle much smaller weapons. In fact, the battle axes were even taller than he was.

Though small in stature, Franco had a great ambition ?— to become the Northern Vale's greatest warrior, and to have his name remembered in the book of heroes, to be adulated by future generations. To achieve this ambition, Franco trained relentlessly day after day, increasing his strength and martial prowess. Yet, no matter how hard Franco trained, he was looked down upon by the others for his short stature. Even his father and brothers believed that little Franco was only suited to be a merchant, and never a warrior or sailor who could take on the cruel environment and ferocious enemies.

Facing constant mockery and discrimination, Franco angrily decided to leave his tribe. He would prove to all of them that, even if he was little, he could still achieve his great things. Over the next few years, he hid away in the Northern Vale's endless mountains, surviving and training alone in that most extreme of environments. After many long years of fighting the bitter cold, terrible beasts, and ever-present threats, Franco developed a strength far exceeding an ordinary man's, as well as a firm and indomitable character.

Whilst Franco was training alone in the mountains, the cruel and power-hungry Captain Bane descended upon the Frozen Sea. Breaking the long-respected rules of the Northern Vale's pirates and fishermen, he began to invade and annex the territory of other pirates as well as commoners, ruling them with an iron fist. Those facing Bane's powerful fleet and fearsome firepower had only two options: submit, or be annihilated.

Bane's cruelty drew fierce resistance from various forces, the fiercest of all coming from Franco's tribe. As a warning to those who would defy him, Bane sent a massive armada of pirate ships to blockade the surrounding sea, and sent constant raids on Franco's tribe, declaring he would sink all their ships, and raze their harbor to the ground.

After ten years in the mountains, Franco returned to his tribe, full of confidence and strength. Descending upon the ferocious battle, he crushed Franco's henchmen with his anchor and god-like strength. Only after the battle did his oppressed tribesmen make a surprising discovery: that the hero who had come to save them was none other than the once-mocked little Franco. After learning of Bane's treacherous actions, Franco angrily swore to annihilate him and all his henchmen.

Franco then led his tribesmen and their ships in resistance against Bane's cruel rule. They equipped old fishing ships with battering rams and cannons, and attacked Bane's pirate fleets wherever they were found, dealing a heavy blow against Bane's forces. In desperation, Bane gathered an enormous fleet to suppress Franco's resistance, but both sides remained in a deadlock after several battles, with Bane unable to force an advantage. Once, Bane managed to lead Franco into a trap, but only managed to wound him, and Franco managed to escape with his life. Furthermore, more and more people of the Northern Vale, inspired by Franco's courage and strength, united around him to fight Bane.

Seeing Franco's strength grow steadily by the day, the cunning Captain Bane came up with a plan: he would sue for peace with Franco, suggesting that they search for the Twilight Orb of legend together, while secretly drawing the Moniyan Empire's navy to the Frozen Sea. This would allow him to kill two birds with one stone: find the Twilight Orb, and defeat Franco for good. Suspicious of Bane's sudden goodwill, Franco pretended to take the bait, ordering his men to search for the Twilight Orb, while secretly leading a contingent of warriors to seize control of a pirate ship among the Black Sharks fleet

Bane instigated a battle between the two navies, preparing to reap the benefits for himself in the aftermath. However, Franco, hidden within the Black Sharks, ordered his men to open fire from behind Bane, making a direct hit on the Behemoth. In his most exultant moment, Bane and his flagship received a deadly blow from the defiant lord, and sank to the bottom of the sea.

With Bane drowned, Franco became ruler of the entire coast of the Northern Vale. He led his people to drive out the remnants of Bane's forces, rebuild the harbor, and restart trade, bringing a renaissance to the entire Northern Vale.

Out of respect for Franco's glorious achievements, the people of the Northern Vale titled him the Frozen Warrior. But to Franco, all that he had done so far was still not worthy of such praise. Not long after, Franco learned that Bane not only had not perished, but had gained a new power, and was gathering his men to make his return.</li></h5>

	<h1> GUSION </h1>
	<h4> Quote:  Take a guess, at how many swords I have? My blade moves with the shadows. Just try to keep up with me. To the hidden blade, all life is equal. My swordsmanship is almost as good looking as I am. Magic lies in the mind. No need to be so jealous, I was born for this. Break the limits! </h4>
	<h5><li>The Paxley family is one of the most powerful, proud and prestigious magic families in the Land of Dawn, and each of it's member is raised to become a mage of the finest order. In their eyes, the path of the magician is the most sacred and noble vocation there is, and all those who brandish a sword in battle are merely considered as insubstantial weaklings and dim-witted fools. Gusion, however, was determined to break the mold. The patriarch's fourth son, Gusion, exhibited a high affinity towards light elements at a very early age, but rather than spend his days with his nose buried in a book studying spells, Gusion would use his control over light to imbue himself with the speed, to run laps of the family estate in mere minutes, and to enchant old ceremonial swords with powerful magical properties of the Holy light. He always believed that the family elders were incurably stubborn and rebelled against their wishes at every opportunity.

Finally, Gusion was given the chance to prove himself, when the time came for him to take the Paxley family's most important test — a rite of passage into adulthood. With Gusion's blistering speed in battle, his opponent was unable to lock onto his position, and with his light-charged blade, he claimed victory before his opponent even had a chance to launch a single spell. The elders were in awe of his incredible form and fighting technique, but with their deep-rooted prejudice against physical combat and their strict adherence to tradition, they could not accept this unorthodoxy and gave Gusion two choices: to either abandon his fighting style or be banished from the family. Facing such adversity and unable to control his rebelliously independent nature, Gusion chose to leave the family. Given his choice, the dark mages of the Elder Council appeared before Gusion, tarnishing him with their lightning magic, and vowing to bring him to justice.

However, Gusion only smiled; he considered all this family oath to be nothing but bullshit. In quick succession, he wiped out all the dark mages, giving them not even the slightest moment, to retaliate. He turned to give his family and hometown, one last disgusted look before leaving, convinced that soon the entire Land of Dawn would know his name and understand the true extent of his power.

Today, Gusion wields his Holy Blade with ruthless proficiency, dealing series of deadly blows to his enemies, within the blink of an eye. When faced with opponents who also aspired to become great assassins, he would demonstrate much superior fighting techniques than expected.

	<h1> HANZO </h1>
	<h4> Quote: Becoming a part of me, is a gift to my enemies </h4>
	<h5><li>Long ago, the House of Akakage was hailed as the Gods of Ninja Arts. For generations, the Akakages researched and taught advanced ninjutsu. In order to achieve the pinnacle of ninja arts, the Akakages used forbidden ninjutsu to rid their hearts of evil, anger, and greed by condensing them into a demon called, Hanekage. No one expected that Hanekage would have consciousness despite lurking within their bodies.

When the legendary One Hundred Ghosts attacked the House of Akakage, the demon within them merged the ghosts to become a single entity. Thus began a bloody feud between the Akakage and the powerful demon. Hanekage. At a grave cost, the Akakage used the ninjutsu, Blood Shadow, to temporarily seal the demon. In order to permanently seal Hanekage, the Akakages used their sacred tools to create a legendary sword, known as Ame no Habakiri. Not long after, the forefathers of the Akakage perished from the world. Their grieving disciples hid Ame no Habakiri in an unknown place that the only members of the Akakage family could reach. Little did the Akakage know, the cunning Goddess of Death, Izanami, observed these events and secretly inserted a part of her soul in one of their progeny to one day resurrect Hanekage.

After many generations, the House of Akakage was divided into the Crimson and Shadow factions. The Shadow Faction gave birth to the strongest Akakage the clan has even seen — Hanzo. As one would expect, Hanzo became the head of the Shadow Faction.

However, one day, Hanzo's team discovered his secret. All this time, Hanzo secretly fused Hanekage's power with his own body, feeding the demon with blood of his enemies. When confronted by the Akakage's Crimson Faction, Hanzo killed them all in cold blood. Absorbing the blood of such powerful people, Hanekage regained consciousness once again.

Hanekage told Hanzo that his noble clan hid the powerful Ame no Habakiri, as well as scared ninjutsu, in a secret location only the Akakage could reach. The power-hungry Hanzo abused his blood right to acquire the forbidden ninjutsu and the fabled sword, Ame no Habakiri. The remaining members of the Akakage furiously chased after the clan's traitor

Emboldened by the power of the Hanekage, Hanzo used his own clan's sword against them and tore the powerful energy from their flesh. Desperate, the two Akakage factions came together once again to take on Hanzo as one. Heavily wounded, the final members of the noble House of Akakage could only watch Hanzo escape.

Hanzo secretly takes refuge recovers from his injuries. Night and day, Hanzo practiced the Akakage's forbidden ninjutsu with Ame no Habakiri. After a decade, Hanzo could not achieve the pinnacle of ninjutsu like his forefathers. Hanekage consumed the flesh and blood of fallen ninjas and transformed into a magical armor for Hanzo. Hanekage struck a deal with Hanzo. In exchange for feeding Hanekage more blood, the powerful demon will help Hanzo reach the pinnacle of ninjutsu. Possessing the ability to reach the pinnacle of ninjutsu and the Ame no Habakiri, Hanzo brought blood bathe to the world.</li></h5>

	<h1> SILVANNA </h1>
	<h4> Quote: "For the people I shall never back down!"Only lights can drive out the darkness </h4>
	<h5><li>The prince had gone missing and no one knew if he were dead or alive, For the sake of the country and the safety of its people, King Aurelius II had decreed to expand the Imperial Knight's Order and set up fortresses within the outskirts of Moniyan, to reinforce the empire’s defense. In the meantime, the Imperial Knights continued their search for any clues or whereabouts of the prince. The Imperial Knight's searched day after night. They had almost crossed the entire Land of Dawn, but all they could find was endless waiting. The Aurelius royal family was drowning in sorrow. To young Silvanna, the tragic memory of that time was too heavy. As a princess, Silvanna had always had a heart of justice and compassion since she was little. After her brother's disappearance, she had been keeping the queen's company almost every day. For years, the two of them had been waiting for a miracle to happen in the Imperial castle. However, waiting, day after day, and year after year later the queen eventually became ill and bedridden from physical and mental exhaustion.

Twelve years had passed after the tragic event. As the queen and the king got old, Princess Silvanna, who had grown into a fine adult, had always wanted to do something for her empire. She wanted to let go of the sorrow, but whenever she thought of her brother, the sadness and frustration always came back to her. Every night in her dream, Silvanna felt like her brother was within reach, but she just couldn't seem to hold him. Shortly afterward, on the day of Silvanna's coming-of-age ceremony, she decided to disregard her status as a princess and join the Imperial Knights. Perhaps this was the only way for her to bear the pain! In the Knight’s Order, Silvanna would have to go through tough training. She would no longer be treated like a royal. Silvanna possessed strong faith and worked harder than the others. Her faith had made her more and more powerful. All the scars on her body were the best proof on her path to training. Before long, she had become the most powerful female knight among the Imperial Knights. But even then, Silvanna still couldn’t get Tigreal's special approval. Tigreal knew the cruelty of the real battlefield and how there' was no room for any mistake. Deep down, Tigreal saw that Silvanna had already acquired all the skills of a knight. He could also see Silvanna's determination. But she was a royal of the empire after all. Tigreal didn't want another successor of the empire to be at any risk again.

But one day, all of a sudden, the Demon army had arrived on the outskirts of the empire... Moniyan was in the face of disaster and war. Tigreal ordered Silvanna to stay in the empire while he leads the whole Knight’s Order to battle.

Halfway through, Tigreal received a report from the Knight’s Order that in order to prove herself, Silvanna had broken the forbidden area, the Imperial Sanctuary, where countless unknown creatures lurk. Even Tigreal himself didn't have the confidence to go through it unharmed. At this moment, a sharp cry came from a distance, making Tigreal shudder. He immediately leads the elites of the Knight’s Order back to the Imperial Sanctuary while the rest of the knights marched to the outskirts of the empire to fight the Demons. On his way, he prayed that he could make it in time. He prayed that his fear should not come true.

In front of the gods of the Imperial Sanctuary, a giant figure was slowly approaching the wounded knightess. The Seed of Light was glowing in the distance and her powerful opponent was approaching. In the imperial records, Silvanna once read about a legend about the Seed of Light in the Imperial Sanctuary. But the powerful creature that guards the Seed of Light in front of her has become an obstacle she couldn't overcome. But Silvanna knew that only when she was shielded by the Lord of Light could she truly become the Holy Knightess and lead the empire to victory in the battle. And for that reason, she was willing to sacrifice her life...

But that wasn't necessary, Silvanna's determination impressed the God of Light and he passed down some of his magical powers to Silvanna. With this power in hand, she broke past the Guard and brought the chaotic army to an end. With the battle won and peace returned, Silvanna's courage brought her great fame.

With power, courage, and royalty in her blood, she took over as the Princess of the Moniyan Empire and perhaps... also as it's protector.</li></h5>

	<h5><li>Many years ago, a prince was born in the Moniyan Empire. As the royal heir to the throne, Prince Aurelius was a symbol of salvation and justice for the people of the empire. It was believed that he would lead the Moniyan Empire in unifying the Land of Dawn. The Nobles of the Empire gave everything they could to grow the prince into the ideal man he was to be.

But, on the day of the prince's first birthday, he was nowhere to be found in his baby bed, which was blanketed in blood. The room was covered with claw marks and the guards in charge of protecting the prince were found dead. Sorrow engulfed the whole Moniyan Empire. The hope of the Empire had fallen and, to this day, there had never been such an inspiring prince. Some people believed the prince was taken and killed by the Demons, while others hoped the prince was still alive. The Empire Nobles appointed the Imperial Knights and the Monastery of Light to find out the truth. At the same time, faraway, within the Crack of the Abyss, the Son of Darkness was born.

Several years passed, something strange appeared in the Southern Hills of the Moniyan Empire. In the deepest part of the Abyss, Thamuz, the Lord Lava, watched a special battle. In this glorious battle, the monsters fought against the son of darkness, until the strongest emerged. He not only possessed the best Evil Gene but also proved to be the strongest fighter among the Demons. Alice embraced the beloved fighter and recalled the Royal Plan that she had carried out. She considered him to be her masterpiece. He mastered all of Alice's tricks, deception and military strategy. He also learned combat from Thamuz. Now, the Son of Darkness was a capable assistant for the Abyss. He would represent the Lord of the Abyss, fight against the Moniyan Empire, implement the "Dawn Plan" and destroy the "Shining Spark" of the Empire forever.
